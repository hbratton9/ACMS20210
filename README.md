Sample problems from introductory C++ class centered around applied mathematics.
Most problems are pretty straight forward.

The header files are for the Euler's Method and Monte Carlo Integral Calculator programs. 
The names are from when I turned them in... I was a bit lazy in changing them.
The key and encrypted text for the substitution cipher are just examples. You could use any key you want (so long as it is in the same format) and my program should work.

Feel free to use what I have however you would like (NOTE: For this class, my professor only cared that our code worked, 
                                                           so if some of what I have written is inefficient I apologize 
                                                           in advance.)
